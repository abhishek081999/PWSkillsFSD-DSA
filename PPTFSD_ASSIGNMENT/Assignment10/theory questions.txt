Q.1 Explain Middlewares in NodeJS ?
In Node.js, middleware is a concept that refers to functions or modules that sit between the server and the routes, allowing for additional processing of requests and responses. Middlewares provide a way to execute custom logic during the request-response cycle, enabling functionalities like authentication, logging, error handling, and more.
Here are some key points about middlewares in Node.js:
1. Order of Execution: Middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined in the application's middleware stack. Each middleware has access to the request (`req`) and response (`res`) objects and can modify them or perform additional operations.
2. Request Processing: Middleware can intercept and process incoming requests before they reach the route handlers. It can inspect request headers, body, and parameters, and perform actions such as data validation, authentication checks, or request transformations.
3. Response Processing: Middleware can also modify or enhance the response object before it is sent back to the client. This includes adding headers, modifying the response body, or performing post-processing operations on the response.
4. Next Function: Middleware functions have access to a `next` function, which is used to pass control to the next middleware in the stack. By calling `next()`, the current middleware completes its execution and hands off the request to the next middleware in line.
5. Error Handling: Middlewares can handle errors that occur during the request-response cycle. If an error occurs, the middleware can either handle it directly or pass it to an error-handling middleware using the `next` function.
6. Reusability: Middlewares are designed to be reusable. They can be created as separate modules and applied to different routes or applications as needed. This promotes code organization and modularity.
7. Middleware Frameworks: Node.js has several popular middleware frameworks such as Express.js and Koa.js that provide a robust middleware ecosystem. These frameworks simplify the creation and usage of middlewares, offering a range of pre-built middlewares and facilitating easy integration.
Overall, middlewares in Node.js act as intermediaries between the server and the routes, allowing for additional processing, modification, and control during the request-response cycle. They enable the implementation of cross-cutting concerns and enhance the functionality and extensibility of Node.js applications.
Q.2 Why use Express Over NodeJS ?

It offers a higher-level abstraction, a rich set of features, and a vibrant community, making it a popular choice for building web applications with Node.js.

Q.3 What are REST API ?
REST (Representational State Transfer) API (Application Programming Interface) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It is a set of principles and constraints that dictate how client-server communication should occur over the web.

Here are the key characteristics and principles of REST APIs:

1. Stateless: REST APIs are stateless, meaning that each request from a client to a server contains all the necessary information for the server to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client state between requests.

2. Client-Server Architecture: REST APIs follow a client-server model, where the client initiates requests and the server processes them. This separation of concerns allows for independent evolution and scalability of the client and server components.

3. Uniform Interface: REST APIs have a uniform interface, which means they follow a consistent set of predefined rules and standards. This includes the use of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources, and the use of URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) to identify and access those resources.

4. Resource-Based: REST APIs are resource-based, where each resource is identified by a unique URI. Resources represent entities in the application domain, such as users, products, or articles. The client interacts with these resources through the API using the standard HTTP methods.

5. State Transfer: REST APIs transfer the state of a resource between client and server using representations. The server sends a representation of a resource (e.g., JSON, XML) in response to a client request, and the client can modify or delete the resource by sending a representation back to the server.

6. Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS): REST APIs can include hypermedia links within the representations, allowing clients to navigate through the API by following these links. HATEOAS enables a self-discoverable and self-descriptive API.

REST APIs are widely used for building web services and are language-agnostic, meaning they can be implemented in any programming language that supports HTTP. They provide a scalable and flexible approach for building distributed systems, enabling different clients to interact with server resources over the internet.
Q.4 What is the use of MongoDB?
MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database that is designed to handle large amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data. It offers a flexible and scalable solution for storing and managing data in a document-oriented format.

Here are some key use cases and advantages of using MongoDB:
