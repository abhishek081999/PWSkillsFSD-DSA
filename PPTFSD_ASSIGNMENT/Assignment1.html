<!-- Q.1 <!DOCTYPE html> is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it?

Ans -> <!DOCTYPE html> is not an HTML tag but a document type declaration used to 
indicate that the HTML document should be treated as HTML5 and to ensure consistent 
rendering across browsers. -->




<!-- Q.2 Explain Semantic tags in html? And why do we need it?

Ans -> Semantic tags in HTML are elements that carry meaning or convey the purpose and 
structure of the content within the tags. These tags provide a way to describe the different 
sections and elements of a web page in a more meaningful and understandable manner.

Some examples of semantic tags introduced in HTML5 include `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, 
`<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`, and many more. 
These tags help to define the purpose and role of different parts of a web page.

Here are a few reasons why semantic tags are important:

1. **Accessibility:** Semantic tags improve accessibility by providing a more descriptive 
structure to web pages. Screen readers and assistive technologies can better 
understand the content and provide a more meaningful experience to users with disabilities.

2. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO):** Search engines can better understand the structure 
and content of a web page when semantic tags are used. This can positively impact 
search engine rankings and improve the visibility of the page in search results.

3. **Code Readability and Maintainability:** Semantic tags make the HTML code more readable 
and understandable for developers. By using tags that reflect the purpose of the content, 
it becomes easier to navigate and maintain the codebase, especially in larger projects.

4. **Separation of Structure and Presentation:** Semantic tags promote a clear separation 
of structure and presentation in web development. By using semantic tags, you focus on 
structuring the content, while CSS is used for presentation and styling. 
This separation enhances code modularity and makes it easier to update the 
visual aspects of the website.

5. **Future-proofing:** Semantic tags provide a standardized way of representing content. 
This allows for easier adoption of new technologies and future enhancements to HTML. 
It ensures that your web pages will continue to be interpreted correctly by 
modern browsers and devices.

Overall, semantic tags enhance the semantics and meaning of HTML documents, improving 
accessibility, search engine optimization, code maintainability, and future compatibility. 
They contribute to a better web experience for both humans and machines. -->





<!-- Q.3 Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements?

Ans -> HTML tags are the individual markers used to define the structure of an HTML document, 
while HTML elements are complete units consisting of opening and closing tags and the 
content within them. Elements are formed by combining tags and represent 
specific parts or structures within an HTML document. -->

<!-- 1. **Improved Semantics**: HTML5 introduced new semantic elements such as `<header>`, 
    `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, etc., which allow developers to provide 
    clearer structure and meaning to their web pages. This improves accessibility, 
    search engine optimization (SEO), and overall code readability.
    
    2. **Enhanced Multimedia Support**: HTML5 provides native support for embedding multimedia 
    elements like `<audio>` and `<video>` without the need for third-party 
    plugins like Adobe Flash. This enables easier and more efficient integration of multimedia 
    content into web pages, enhancing the user experience.
    
    3. **Canvas Element**: HTML5 introduced the `<canvas>` element, which allows dynamic 
    rendering and manipulation of graphics, animations, and visualizations directly within the 
    browser, without relying on external technologies like Flash or Java applets. 
    
    4. **Form Enhancements**: HTML5 introduced new input types (e.g., `email`, `url`, `date`, 
    `number`) and attributes (e.g., `required`, `placeholder`, `pattern`) that simplify form 
    validation and enhance user input experiences. Additionally, HTML5 introduced the 
    `<datalist>` element, which provides suggestions as users type in an input field. 
    
    These several advantages have made HTML5 a popular choice for web development, enabling developers 
    to create more sophisticated, interactive, and accessible web experiences. -->

<!-- Q.8 What is the difference between <figure> tag and <img> tag?


    Ans -> The `<figure>` tag and the `<img>` tag serve different purposes in HTML and have 
    distinct roles:
    
    1. `<img>` tag:
       The `<img>` tag is used to embed images into a web page. It is a void element, which 
       means it does not have a closing tag. The `<img>` tag requires a `src` attribute, 
       which specifies the URL of the image to be displayed. Additionally, you can include 
       optional attributes such as `alt`, `width`, `height`, etc.
    
       Example of using the `<img>` tag:
       
       <img src="example.jpg" alt="Example Image" width="300" height="200">
      
       In this example, the `<img>` tag displays the image `example.jpg`, and the `alt` attribute 
       provides alternative text for the image (important for accessibility and SEO purposes).
    
    2. `<figure>` tag:
       The `<figure>` tag is used to group multimedia content, such as images, illustrations, 
       videos, audio, etc., and their respective captions using the `<figcaption>` tag. 
       The purpose of the `<figure>` element is to associate the content and its caption together.
    
       Example of using the `<figure>` tag with `<figcaption>`:
       
       <figure>
         <img src="example.jpg" alt="Example Image" width="300" height="200">
         <figcaption>Figure 1: This is an example image.</figcaption>
       </figure>
      
    
    In this example, the `<figure>` tag wraps the `<img>` tag, which contains the image, and the 
    `<figcaption>` tag provides a caption for the image.
    
    So, the key difference is that the `<img>` tag is specifically used for embedding images, 
    while the `<figure>` tag is used to group multimedia content along with its associated caption. 
    The `<figure>` tag is useful when you want to semantically associate an image or other 
    multimedia elements with explanatory text or captions. -->








<!-- 
    Q.9 Whatâ€™s the difference between html tag and attribute and give example of some 
global attributes?


Ans -> In HTML, there are two main concepts: tags and attributes.

1. **HTML Tags**:
   HTML tags are the building blocks of an HTML document. They define the structure and 
   content of a webpage. Tags are represented by angle brackets (`<` and `>`) and come in 
   pairs - an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag contains the name of the element, 
   while the closing tag has the same name but with a forward slash before it (`</`). 
   The content between the opening and closing tags is the content of the element.

   Example of an HTML tag:
   
   <p>This is a paragraph tag.</p>
   

2. **HTML Attributes**:
   HTML attributes are used to provide additional information or settings to HTML elements. 
   They are applied within the opening tag and provide extra properties to the element. 
   Attributes consist of a name and a value, separated by an equal sign (`=`). 
   The value is usually enclosed in double quotes. Attributes can be used to control the 
   appearance, behavior, or functionality of an element.

   Example of an HTML attribute:
   
   <img src="example.jpg" alt="Example Image">
   

   In this example, the `<img>` tag has two attributes: `src` and `alt`. The `src` attribute 
   specifies the source URL of the image to display, while the `alt` attribute provides 
   alternative text for the image, which is important for accessibility and SEO.

**Global Attributes**:
Global attributes are attributes that can be applied to most HTML elements. 
They are not specific to any particular tag and can be used across different elements.

Some examples of global attributes are:
- `id`: Specifies a unique identifier for an element.
- `class`: Assigns one or more class names to an element for CSS styling or JavaScript manipulation.
- `style`: Applies inline CSS styles directly to the element.
- `title`: Provides additional information about the element (usually displayed as a tooltip).
- `lang`: Specifies the language of the content within the element.
- `data-*`: Allows custom data attributes to be added for JavaScript to access and manipulate.
- `tabindex`: Specifies the order of focus for keyboard navigation.
- `aria-*`: Provides accessibility information for screen readers and other assistive technologies.

In short, HTML tags define the structure and content of a webpage, while HTML attributes 
provide additional information or settings to elements. Global attributes are attributes
 that can be applied to many HTML elements and are not specific to any particular tag. -->
